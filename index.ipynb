    "You'll use a dataset created by the Otto group, which was also used in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge/data). The description of the dataset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Otto Group is one of the world’s biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including Crate & Barrel (USA), Otto.de (Germany) and 3 Suisses (France). They are selling millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to their product line.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consistent analysis of the performance of their products is crucial. However, due to their global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently. Therefore, the quality of product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insights the Otto Group can generate about their product range.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use a dataset containing:\n",
    "- A column `id`, which is an anonymous id unique to a product\n",
    "- 93 columns `feat_1`, `feat_2`, ..., `feat_93`, which are the various features of a product\n",
    "- a column `target` - the class of a product\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The dataset is stored in the `'otto_group.csv'` file. Import this file into a DataFrame called `data`, and then: \n",
